# Tomasulo Architecture Simulator üìä

## Project Description üìù
This simulator implements the Tomasulo algorithm to demonstrate dynamic scheduling to resolve conflicts in hardware. This Java and JavaFX project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes instruction processing, reservations stations, register status, and execution in real-time.

## Features üåü
- **Dynamic Instruction Scheduling**: Simulates the Tomasulo algorithm with real-time updates to reservation stations and registers.
- **Customizable Simulation Parameters**: Users can define the size of reservation stations and cache properties.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Allows for an interactive simulation with step-by-step execution through the GUI.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- JavaFX SDK (Compatible with your Java version)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Configuration
Before running the simulator, ensure JavaFX is correctly configured on your IDE or command line setup.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Running the Simulator
1. Compile and run the `Main.java` file using your IDE or the command line.
2. Load the instruction set and register file by placing your `.txt` files in the `src` directory.

### Input Files
- **Instructions.txt**: Contains a list of instructions to be processed.
    ```
    L.D F6, 0
    DADDI R1, R1, 260
    DADDI R2, R1, 353
    DSUBI R1, R2, 144
    DADDI R4, R1, 150
    L.D F2, 10
    ```

- **Registers.txt**: Initial state of registers.
    ```

    *Note: The first 32 elements correspond to the value of R(X) and the other 32 correspond to the value of F(X).*

### Using the GUI
- Configure the buffer sizes and latencies as prompted.
- Run the simulation to see the Tomasulo algorithm in action.
